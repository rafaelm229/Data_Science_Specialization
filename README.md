# Data Science Specialization

This Specialization covers the concepts and tools you'll need throughout the entire data science pipeline, from asking the right kinds of  questions to making inferences and publishing results. In the final  Capstone Project, you’ll apply the skills learned by building a data  product using real-world data. At completion, students will have a  portfolio demonstrating their mastery of the material.

## Course 1  **The Data Scientist’s Toolbox**

In this course you will get an introduction to the main tools and ideas  in the data scientist's toolbox. The course gives an overview of the  data, questions, and tools that data analysts and data scientists work  with. There are two components to this course. The first is a conceptual introduction to the ideas behind turning data into actionable  knowledge. The second is a practical introduction to the tools that will be used in the program like **version control, markdown, git, GitHub, R,  and RStudio.**
